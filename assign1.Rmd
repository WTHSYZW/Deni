## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r load packages, message=FALSE}
Parklight <- st_read("INFRA_ParkLights.shp.zip")
  Recreation <- st_read("RECREATION_OpenSpace.shp.zip")
  Streetlight <- st_read("INFRA_StreetLights.shp.zip")

  recreation_plot <- ggplot(Recreation) +
  geom_sf()
  
  recreation_plot
  
  Parklight_plot <- ggplot(Parklight) +
  geom_sf()
  
  Streetlight_plot <- ggplot(Streetlight) +
  geom_sf()
  
  Streetlight_plot
  
  ggplot(Streetlight) +
    geom_sf(shape = 13, color = 5, size = 1, alpha = 0.1)
  
    ggplot(Streetlight) +
    geom_sf(shape = 13, color = 5, size = 1, alpha = 0.1) +
    geom_sf(data = Recreation, color = "red",
                               size = 3,
                               fill = "green",
                               alpha = 0.5)
 
 
  ggplot(Recreation) +
  annotation_map_tile(zoomin = 0) +
  geom_sf(data = Streetlight, shape = 13, color = "blue", size = 1, alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_sf(data = Recreation, color = "red",
                             fill = "red",
                             alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(caption = "Map tiles and data by OpenStreetMap")
  
  
  



## Including Plots


plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
